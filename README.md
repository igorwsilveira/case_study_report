<h1> Case Study Sales Report </h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

In this project, I will perform the creation of dashboards, so the retailer can visualize the current sales data in different parameters based on their database. To do this we need tools such as Excel and Power BI.

<h2>Scenario</h2>

Y Electronics has stores over in a few capitals states in Brazil. This way is essential to keep track of their sales, products, returns, and profits. They're looking for improvements in their sales reports, moving from static reports to visual dashboards.

<h2>Business Request</h2>

- How much Y Electronics sold of what products, and how it has been over the year of 2019.
- Which city has the best sales performance and their volume of sales.
- Measure the rates returns of products.

<h3>Business Demand Overview</h3>

1. Dashboard of stores performance regards total sales.
2. Dashboard that shows profit per month in the whole year of 2019.
3. Dashboard that shows the most sold items.

<h2>Data Transformation</h2>

- The actual data was taken from Kaggle and was extracted by using SQL Server into CSV files to perform their use in Power BI.
- There are two tables used in this project:

1. Sales: This Table has details about the sales history of 2019, such as Product, Profit, Sales, Price of Items, Date, Store, and Clients Names.

2. Returns: This table is focused on the return of items. Contain most returned Products, Date, Store and Price.
